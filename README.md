# Supervised-Learning-Algorithms

Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. 
As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.

## How supervised learning works
Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression:

Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.
Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business. Linear regression, logistical regression, and polynomial regression are popular regression algorithms.

## Challenges of supervised learning
Although supervised learning can offer businesses advantages, such as deep data insights and improved automation, there are some challenges when building sustainable supervised learning models. The following are some of these challenges:

  -Supervised learning models can require certain levels of expertise to structure accurately.  
  -Training supervised learning models can be very time intensive.  
  -Datasets can have a higher likelihood of human error, resulting in algorithms learning incorrectly.  
  -Unlike unsupervised learning models, supervised learning cannot cluster or classify data on its own.  

## Supervised Learning with the help of Sci-kit learn library

Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

The Goal of this repositry is to apply famous machine learning algorithms on the IRIS dataset with the help of scikit learn and compare there performances.
